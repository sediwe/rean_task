Approach: 

I created Cloudformation Stack to create AWS Resources which included an Amazon Linux EC2 Instance(VPC, Subnet etc)

I opened both SSH and HTTP Ports

I logged into the EC2 instance using SSH

Ansible was installed on the EC2 instance

I used ansible playbook to download wordpress
